# Levo Take Home

I have used NextJS to build the project and using Now to deploy the project. Demo can be found [here](https://levo-take-home.vercel.app/).

## Installation

I am using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as my package manager

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

You can install dependencies running

```bash
yarn
```

## Scripts

```bash
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "eslint": "eslint src/* --ext .jsx"
  }
```

## Missing

Due to time constraints I didn't add in bootstrap and opted to use plain css
